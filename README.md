# DCGAN-Face-Generator
Using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new images of faces with PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the requirements for the completion of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. It consists of building and training a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces using PyTorch. 

## Project Result

Examples of faces generated with the model defined in the dlnd_face_generation_.ipynb :
